# Final Assignment

Inital concept for piece was a conceise but working weather application to run passivaly. For the final project, I wanted to get more experience using JSON files and API's in terms of generating and manipulating large data sets. In this I thought of a weather application, current days, which takes weather data from a location search and displays it in two forms, 1st with a numerical point, and 2nd using Particles.js to create snowfall for each day (for the holiday season). Depending on how cold it is the amount of particles per day will be less or more. On hover, it hides the other sections.

#### :two:Frontend Focused

#### :three:API Integration into flinal project
For the weather data I pulled from Wonderground weather API having some previous experience with it.
For Particles I tried to use ParticleJS http://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/ having some use on it's own but not when intregrating it with the final data sets.
